# ESPVolumeControl - A simple way to control your the Volume of OpenHAB2-Items

What will be created here is a Sketch that is written in the Arduino IDE for ESP8266 to control your speakers via the REST interface of OpenHAB2. The Input will be from a rotary encoder and a few buttons.

Great, now why is everything so weird here?

Well since this is my first time publishing any of my work online and working with github I'm still learning how to use everything - so if I'm doing anything wrong just let me know! Any help will be appreciated!


I already have a first working version that I will improve in the next few days so I can publish it here.
